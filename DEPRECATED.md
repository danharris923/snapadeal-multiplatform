# ‚ö†Ô∏è REPOSITORY DEPRECATED

This repository has been **DEPRECATED** due to security concerns.

## Security Incident

This repository inadvertently exposed sensitive credentials in its git history:
- Google Cloud service account private keys
- Supabase service role keys
- Firebase configuration with API keys

## New Repository

**Please use the new clean repository:**

### üîó https://github.com/danharris923/snapadeal-multiplatform-v2

The new repository contains:
- ‚úÖ Clean git history (no exposed secrets)
- ‚úÖ All latest code and features
- ‚úÖ Enterprise git workflow (main/dev/android/ios branches)
- ‚úÖ Proper secret management with .env files
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive security documentation

## What Happened

Secrets were accidentally committed and pushed to this public repository. While the files have been removed from the latest commits, they remain in git history, which cannot be easily cleaned without rewriting history and breaking all existing clones.

## Action Taken

1. All exposed credentials have been rotated
2. Created fresh repository without the compromised history
3. Implemented improved security practices
4. This repository will be archived

## For Contributors

If you have:
- Pending pull requests ‚Üí Please resubmit to the new repository
- Local clones ‚Üí Please clone the new repository
- Bookmarks/links ‚Üí Update to the new URL

Thank you for your understanding!
